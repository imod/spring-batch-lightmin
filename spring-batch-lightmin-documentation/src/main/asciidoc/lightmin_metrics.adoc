== Spring Batch Lightmin Metrics

Lightmin Metrics introduces some custom metrics for the Lightmin-Platform.
It uses Micrometer to collect metrics.
The metrics are available for client and server applications.

=== Enabling Client Metrics

In order to collect metrics of a _Lightmin_ client application, the following property has to be to _true_.

[source,yaml]
----
spring:
    batch:
        lightmin:
            client:
                metrics-enabled: true #default true
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you want to use runtime information of a client on a server, the following property has to be set to true.
The send information will be transformed to metrics on the server, if the sever metrics feature is enabled.
====

[source,yaml]
----
spring:
    batch:
        lightmin:
            client:
                publish-job-events: true #default true
----

=== Enabling Server Metrics

In order to collect metrics of a _Lightmin_ server , the following property has to be to _true_.

[source,yaml]
----
spring:
    batch:
        lightmin:
            server:
                metrics-enabled: true #default true
----

=== Exposing Metrics via actuator

In order to expose the collected metrics, a _Micrometer_ registry dependencies has to be added to the client and the server.

For prometheus, the following dependencies has to be added

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.micrometer</groupId>
  <artifactId>micrometer-registry-prometheus</artifactId>
  <version>${micrometer.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
The lightmin dependencies do not provide any registries out of the box
====

=== Modifying Lighmin Metrics

Metrics will be published over prometheus actuator and can be modified by adding MeterFilter into the metrics configuration.
Refer to Micrometer Documentation for more information.

[source,java]

@Configuration
public class Config{

final static String name = "EXAMPLE";

@Bean
public MeterRegistryCustomizer<MeterRegistry> metricsCommonTags() {
        return registry -> {
            if (name != null) {
                registry.config().meterFilter(
                        new MeterFilter() {
                            @Override
                            public DistributionStatisticConfig configure(Meter.Id id, DistributionStatisticConfig config) {
                                if (id.getName().startsWith("lightmin")) {
                                    // Example Filter - Activating histogram on all lightmin metrics
                                    return DistributionStatisticConfig.builder().percentilesHistogram(true)
                                            .percentiles(0.95)
                                            .build()
                                            .merge(config);
                                }
                                return config;
                            }
                        })
                        .commonTags("example_tag", name);
            }
        };
    }
}

=== Grafana Dashboards

Lightmin Metrics introduces prebuild Grafana Dashboards for server and client.
The json files are available in the resources folder of the lightmin-metrics project.
In order to use the plugin, please install the following Plugins:

* Statusmap by Flant JSC

==== Lightmin Dashboard

The _Spring Batch Lightmin_ Dashboard provides information about all Lightmin clients which are configured as target in Prometheus.
The following variables are available:

* Service - taken from the tag _APPLICATION_NAME_ (Lightmin Clients should be listed here)
* Job Name - Name of all jobs, or all jobs of the selected _Services_
* Job Count Interval - Time period for the overall _SUCCESSFUL_ and _FAILED_ overview

image::grafana_all.png[]

If a specific Job Name is selected, the details about the job and step execution will be displayed.

==== Lightmin Server Dashboard

The Server Dashboard provides an overview of all Job Executions, which are send from the clients to the server.
The Lightmin server(s) should be configured as target in Prometheus.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The boards require a Prometheus datasource.
